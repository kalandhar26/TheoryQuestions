# 1. Why Centralized Configuration (Core Concept)

## Why do banking microservices need centralized configuration?

## What types of configs should be centralized vs local? i) Timeouts ii) Feature flags iii)External API endpoints iv) Kafka topics v) Circuit breaker thresholds vi)Logging levels

👉 Hard truth: If configs are bundled with deployment artifacts, every change becomes a release → unacceptable in
banking.

2️⃣ Spring Cloud Config Server – Basics

## How does Config Server fetch properties on service startup?

## How do you set up a Git-backed Config Server?

## How do config clients resolve: application name, profile (dev, uat, prod), label (branch/tag)

3️⃣ Environment, Profile & Region Management (sandbox, prod, multi-region, hybrid cloud)

## How do you manage dev / uat / prod configs centrally?

## How do you handle region-specific configs (e.g., prod-us, prod-in)?

## How does Config Server support composite environments?

## How do you manage hybrid cloud configurations?

👉 Missed by many:
Region ≠ environment. Compliance often differs by geography.

4️⃣ Dynamic Configuration & Hot Reload

## How do you change DB password without restarting services?

## How does @RefreshScope work?

## How do /actuator/refresh and Config Server interact?

## How do you change log level dynamically?

## How do you enable read-only mode across services during DB maintenance?

⚠️ Reality check:

- @RefreshScope = bean reinitialization, not magic
- Stateful beans + refresh = hidden bugs

5️⃣ Broadcasting Config Changes (Scale)

## How do you trigger refresh for all services at once?

## How does Spring Cloud Bus broadcast refresh events?

## Why Kafka/RabbitMQ is preferred for banking environments?

- Git commit → Config Server → Bus → 50 services refresh
- Opportunity cost: Manual refresh = operational risk during incidents.

6️⃣ Security & Encryption (Non-Negotiable) DB passwords, API keys, encryption keys

## How do you encrypt sensitive data using {cipher}?

## How do you rotate encryption keys across all services?

## How do you secure Config Server: i) Basic Auth ii) OAuth2 iii) mTLS?

## How do you prevent developers from seeing prod secrets?

👉 Brutal truth: Git-backed config without encryption = audit failure.

7️⃣ Vault & High-Security Setup

## When should you use Vault instead of Git?

## How does Vault handle: i) dynamic DB credentials ii) secret leasing iii)auto-rotation?

## How do services fetch secrets securely at runtime?

### Use case: i) PCI ii) PII iii)Regulator-mandated secret rotation

8️⃣ Availability, Failover & Resilience

## What happens if Config Server is down?

## How do services use local fallback configs?

## How does config client caching reduce load?

## How do you test config client behavior during network partition?

👉 Blind spot: Config Server is a critical dependency → treat it like infra, not app.

9️⃣ Versioning, Rollback & Governance

## How do you implement config versioning?

## How do you rollback a bad config change?

## How do you support blue-green deployments?

## How do you audit: i) who changed config ii) when was changed iii) why it was changed?

- Git history = compliance artifact.

🔟 Validation & Safe Change Management

## How do you validate config changes before prod?

## How do you prevent invalid configs from breaking services?

## How do you implement approval workflows for prod config changes?

## How do you detect configuration drift across services?

- Reality: Most outages are bad config, not bad code.

1️⃣1️⃣ Feature Toggles & Business Control

## How do you disable features globally during incidents?

## How do you manage feature toggles for gradual rollout?

## How do you support: i) retail vs corporate banking ii) premium vs regular customers

## How do you avoid redeployment for business rule changes?

1️⃣2️⃣ Service-Specific & Legacy Configs

## How do you manage configs for services with different release cycles?

## How do you handle legacy system configuration?

## How do you resolve conflicts between: i) centralized config ii) local overrides

1️⃣3️⃣ Observability & Monitoring of Configuration

## How do you monitor Config Server health?

## How do you expose property sources via Actuator?

## How do you track which services are using which configs?

## How do you notify teams about config changes?

1️⃣4️⃣ Migration Strategy

## How do you migrate from application.yml → Config Server safely?

## How do you avoid breaking existing services?

## How do you roll this out incrementally across banking systems?
