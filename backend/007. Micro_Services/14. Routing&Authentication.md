# 1. Traffic Routing Strategies (Who goes where?)

## 1.1 Banking app needs to route requests based on customer type (retail, business, private banking).

## 1.2 How would you route mobile app traffic differently from web portal traffic?

## 1.3 How does Gateway route based on headers (e.g., X-Channel: mobile)?

## 1.4 Implement role-based routing (teller, manager, admin access to different services).

## 1.5 How would you route requests based on customer's geographic regulations?

## 1.6 How would you route requests during service maintenance?

## 1.7 How would you route traffic during data center failure?

## 1.8 In banking microservices, how does API Gateway handle routing to internal services?

## 1.9 In Spring Cloud Gateway, how do you define routes using YAML?

# 2. Core Authentication Models in Banking

## 2.1 Implement SSO (Single Sign-On) across multiple banking applications.

## 2.2 Implement OAuth2 for third-party financial aggregators.

## 2.3 Implement API key authentication for internal service-to-service communication.

## 2.4 Implement certificate-based authentication for corporate banking clients.

## 2.5 Implement hardware token authentication for high-net-worth customers.

## 2.6 How would you handle authentication for third-party fintech partners?

## 2.7 How would you handle authentication for banking chatbots?

## 2.8 How would you handle authentication for scheduled batch jobs?

## 2.9 Implement anonymous access for public banking information (interest rates, branch locations).

# 3. Multi-Factor, Step-Up & Risk-Based Authentication

## 3.1 Implement multi-factor authentication for high-value transactions.

## 3.2 Implement step-up authentication for sensitive operations (password + OTP + biometric).

## 3.3 Implement risk-based authentication (unusual location triggers additional verification).

## 3.4 Customer traveling abroad – how to handle authentication from different countries?

## 3.5 How would you prevent authentication token theft and replay attacks?

# 4. Session, Token & Identity Lifecycle Management

## 4.1 Regulatory requirement: Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.

## 4.2 Customer's device is lost – need to invalidate all active sessions immediately.

## 4.3 How would you handle authentication token renewal without interrupting user session?

## 4.4 During token expiry, how does Gateway refresh or return 401 gracefully?

## 4.5 How do you handle session-based auth for web portal vs token for mobile?

# 5. Gateway-Based Authentication & Authorization

## 5.1 You need JWT-based auth at Gateway for all APIs. How to validate tokens?

## 5.2 How do you propagate JWT from Gateway to downstream services?

## 5.3 How do you implement role-based access (e.g., admin vs customer) at Gateway?

## 5.4 In banking, how do you protect /admin endpoints with extra auth layer?

## 5.5 You need to block expired/invalid tokens early. How does Gateway validate?

## 5.6 In a banking app, some APIs use OAuth2, others API keys. How does Gateway route + auth?

## 5.7 In microservices, how do you avoid auth at every service by centralizing at Gateway?

# 6. Identity Provider (IdP) Integration

## 6.1 How do you integrate Keycloak or Okta with Gateway for auth?

## 6.2 During SSO login, how does Gateway redirect to identity provider?

# 7. Secure Communication & Encryption

## 7.1 How do you handle mutual TLS between Gateway and backend services?

## 7.2 During cert rotation, how does Gateway handle new certificates without downtime?

## 7.3 In a secure banking setup, how do you combine routing, auth, and encryption?

# 8. Header Management, Tracing & Security Controls

## 8.1 You need to add correlation ID in headers during routing. How?

## 8.2 In Gateway, how do you strip sensitive headers before forwarding?

## 8.3 How does Gateway handle CORS for authenticated requests?

# 9. Rate Limiting, Abuse Prevention & Partner Controls

## 9.1 You need to rate limit per authenticated user. How to combine auth + rate limiting?

## 9.2 How do you implement API key rotation for partner integrations?

# 10. Logging, Audit & Compliance

## 10.1 Regulatory requirement: All authentication attempts must be logged.

## 10.2 How do you log authenticated user details in Gateway for audit?

# 11. Special Scenarios & Edge Cases

## 11.1 How would you handle authentication for offline banking operations?

## 11.2 How does Gateway handle authentication for public APIs (e.g., IFSC lookup)?
