# 1. Cascading Failure Prevention & Core Concepts

## How do you prevent cascading failures when a downstream service (loan/payment/fraud) is down?

## In a chained call (account → transaction → notification), ## How does a circuit breaker prevent cascading failure?

## How does a circuit breaker prevent the whole system from hanging when a dependency is slow or down?

## Rate limiting vs circuit breaking — when should each be used in banking APIs?

## During a network partition, ## How does circuit breaker prevent endless retries?

# 2. Circuit Breaker States & Lifecycle

## How do you handle circuit breaker state transitions (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF-OPEN)?

## How does waitDurationInOpenState allow dependent services time to recover?

## How do you configure permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState?

## How do you implement gradual recovery after a circuit opens?

## How does minimumNumberOfCalls affect frequent circuit openings?

## What is the difference between count-based and time-based sliding windows?

# 3. Thresholds, Timeouts & Failure Detection

## How do you configure timeouts for payment and fund transfer APIs?

## How do you configure failureRateThreshold for transaction services?

## How does slowCallRateThreshold detect slow but non-failing services?

## How do you configure error thresholds for ATM withdrawal APIs?

## How would you configure thresholds for third-party credit bureau APIs with unstable latency?

## How do you configure circuit breaker thresholds based on SLA (e.g., 99.9%)?

## How do you handle different failure types (timeouts vs exceptions)?

# 4. Retry, Backoff & Combination Patterns

## How do you configure retry attempts in Resilience4j?

## How do you combine retry + circuit breaker for KYC or credit verification?

## How do you implement exponential backoff retries?

## When should retries be avoided to prevent system overload?

## How do you prevent retries from overwhelming slow external systems?

# 5. Bulkhead Isolation (Thread / Semaphore)

## How do you implement bulkhead isolation for fraud detection services?

## How does bulkhead prevent thread starvation during slow external calls?

## How do you configure thread pool sizes in Hystrix?

## When should you use semaphore isolation vs thread isolation?

## How does bulkheading help during peak trading or high concurrency scenarios?

# 6. Fallback Strategies & Business Decisions

## How do you implement fallback when credit score service fails?

## What fallback should be s## Hown when circuit is OPEN (e.g., “try later”)?

## When should you not provide fallback (fail-fast for critical transactions)?

## Is approving low-risk loans offline when bureau is down a good practice?

## How do you handle fallback for notification and OTP services without weakening security?

## How do you queue operations (reports, notifications) as fallback instead of failing?

# 7. Service-Specific Resilience Configuration

## How do you configure resilience differently for:

## Real-time fraud detection

## High-value transactions

## Batch loan processing

## Reporting services

## How do you configure circuit breakers differently for idempotent vs non-idempotent APIs?

## How do you handle resilience for customer profile services?

# 8. Third-Party, Legacy & External Systems

## How do you configure resilience for third-party payment gateways?

## How do you handle circuit breaker for external audit services?

## How do you configure circuit breaker for legacy SOAP banking services?

## How do you handle slow or flaky external banks during interbank transfers?

# 9. Multi-Region, DR & Infrastructure Failures

## How do you manage resilience for multi-region services?

## How do you configure circuit breakers for disaster recovery setups?

## How does circuit breaker behave during database failover?

## How does circuit breaker help when connection pools are exhausted?

## How do you configure resilience for hybrid cloud setups?

# 10. Monitoring, Metrics & Audit

## How do you monitor circuit breaker metrics?

## How do you expose circuit breaker states using Spring Boot Actuator?

## How do you integrate circuit breaker metrics with Grafana?

## How do you log circuit breaker events (open/close/half-open) for audit?

## How do you alert operations teams on frequent circuit openings?

# 11. Configuration, Annotations & Tooling

## How do you use @CircuitBreaker annotations in Spring Boot?

## How do you configure circuit breaker to ignore certain exceptions?

## What are Hystrix commandKey and threadPoolKey, and why separate them?

## Why is Hystrix deprecated, and why should banking systems move to Resilience4j?

## How do you test circuit breaker behavior in pre-production environments?

# 12. Advanced & Edge Scenarios
