#### Identifiers

- A Name in Java is called Identifier, Which can be used for identification purpose.
- It can be method name or Variable name or class name or label name.

```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int name = "baba";
        int age = 27;
    }
}
```

- Test (User Defined class name), main (in-built method name), String (in-built class name), args (user defined array
  name), name and age (User defined variable names)

##### Rules for Java Identifiers

**Allowed Characters**

- Letters: A–Z, a–z
- Digits: 0–9
- Special symbols: $ (dollar sign), _ (underscore)
- Any other character (e.g., ! @ # % ^ & * ( )) is not allowed and will cause a compile-time error.

**Starting Character Restriction**

- Identifiers cannot start with a digit.
- Valid: name1, _value, $amount
- Invalid: 1name, 9value

**Case Sensitivity**

- Java is case-sensitive.
- Identifiers with different cases are treated as distinct.
- Example Variable, variable, and VARIABLE are three different identifiers.

**Reserved Words Restriction**

- Identifiers cannot use Java reserved keywords (e.g., class, public, static, void).
- Example: int is invalid as an identifier because it is a reserved word.

| Valid Identifiers | Invalid Identifiers |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| studentName       | 123name             |
| _count            | class               |
| $salary           | @value              |
| data1             | void                |

#### Reserved Words

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Types (8)         | byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char                       |
| Flow Control (11)      | if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return   |
| Modifiers (11)         | public, private, protected, static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, |
|                        | strictfp, transient, volatile                                              |

| Methods                | void                                                                       |

| Enum                   | enum                                                                       |

**Key Insights:**

- All reserved words are lowercase (no uppercase, no special characters, no spaces, no numbers).
- Java does not have a delete keyword — garbage collection handles object destruction.
- enum is used to define a group of named constants.

#### Data Types

- In Java, every variable and every expression has a type.
- Each data type is clearly defined (e.g., int, double, boolean).
- During compilation, the compiler checks type compatibility for every assignment.
- Because of these strict rules, Java is considered a strongly typed programming language.
- Java is object-oriented but not purely OOP due to its reliance on primitives, lack of operator overloading, and
  restriction on multiple inheritance.

#### Literals

- A literal in Java is a fixed constant value that is directly written in the source code.

```java
int x = 100;   // here 100 is a literal
```

| Literal Type          | Example(s)                  | Notes                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integral Literals** | 101, 0146, 0x123Face, 0b101 | • Decimal, Octal (prefix `0`), Hexadecimal (prefix `0x`), Binary (prefix `0b`)                               |
| **Floating-Point**    | 3.14159, 1.2e3f             | • Supports scientific notation (`e` or `E`) <br>• Default type: double <br>• Use suffix `f` or `F` for float |
| **Character**         | 'A', '\n', '\t', '\u0061'   | • Single character in single quotes <br>• Escape sequences allowed <br>• Unicode supported                   |
| **String**            | "Hello", "Java123"          | • Sequence of characters in double quotes <br>• Immutable objects of type `String`                           |
| **Boolean**           | true, false                 | • Only two values <br>• Used in conditional logic                                                            |
| **Null**              | null                        | • Special literal for object references <br>• Represents "no value"                                          |

**Key Insights**

- Literals are fixed constant values written directly in source code.
- Compiler ensures type compatibility when assigning literals to variables.
- Numeric literals can be expressed in different bases (decimal, octal, hex, binary).
- null is the only literal that can be assigned to any reference type.

#### Types of Variables

| Division                   | Type of Variable   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **By Value Type**          | Primitive Variable | Represents primitive data types (`int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.). Stored directly.                                                                                                                                                                                      | int x = 10;                                      |
|                            | Reference Variable | Refers to objects. Stores the memory address of the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Student s = new Student();                       |
| **By Position & Behavior** | Instance Variable  | • Declared inside a class but outside methods/constructors/blocks. <br>• Each object gets its own copy. <br>• Created at object creation, destroyed at object destruction. <br>• Default values provided by JVM. <br>• Accessed via object reference in static methods. | class Student { int age; }                       |
|                            | Static Variable    | • Declared with `static` keyword inside a class but outside methods. <br>• Single copy shared across all objects. <br>• Accessed via class name, object reference, or directly within same class. <br>• Recommended: use class name for clarity.                        | class Student { static String college = "ABC"; } |
|                            | Local Variable     | • Declared inside a method, constructor, or block. <br>• Exists only during method execution. <br>• Must be initialized before use (no default values). <br>• Only modifier allowed: `final`.                                                                           | void display() { int count = 0; }                |

**Key Insights**

- Primitive vs Reference: Primitive holds actual values; Reference holds addresses pointing to objects.
- Instance Variables: Object-level, unique per object.
- Static Variables: Class-level, shared across all objects.
- Local Variables: Temporary, method-level, destroyed after method execution.
- JVM provides default values only for instance and static variables, not for local variables.
